# Tech Tales

A fairy-tale-like tree fills the room, while lights change in a barely perceptible rhythm. Freely available real-time data on forest edges are translated into a play of color and brightness, revealing the current state of forests in different regions of the world. Interactive technical experiments from the research project Living the Forest Lab invite visitors to explore and try things out. They explore the complex interweavings of nature, culture, and technology using multiperspectival approaches to understand our environment, and they playfully experiment with different forms of data visualization.

Ultrasound waves and sounds hidden within fungi warn animals of approaching wildfires. A game experiments with climate variables that alter a digital forest. A buoy drifting on the water collects sensor readings and offers insight into the health of a body of water in Berlin. An open-source instrument makes invisible electromagnetic waves audible and invites visitors to listen, for a moment, with animal senses.

TechTales brings scientific topics to life through artistic installations and interactive elements, raising ecological awareness and communicating science. The exhibition highlights the importance of forests for biodiversity and climate regulation, as well as the mitigation of climate change. It also aims to emphasize the need to explore alternative epistemologies – those that recognize the agency of plants, animals, and machines – and how these might inform more relational and reciprocal modes of technological development. 

The immersive space invites visitors to consider future scenarios, discuss them, and explore ways to shape them in fair and sustainable ways. Developed and produced at TU Berlin, the exhibition is a contribution to innovative science communication.

TechTales is a collaboration between the Living the Forest Lab research project in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Department of Communication Systems), the Master’s program in Stage Design and Scenography and the Science & Society department of the Executive Board at TU Berlin. The Living the Forest Labresearch initiative, which is funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education, focuses on knowledge transfer and forest fire prevention. 

The exhibition will be presented in the UNI_VERSUM in the main building of the TU Berlin and will be part of Berlin Science Week 2025. The UNI_VERSUM is the pilot phase for the TULIUM project, a new transfer and exhibition building on the TU campus that is currently under construction. It tests various formats that are intended to be continued later in the building’s exhibition and event spaces.
